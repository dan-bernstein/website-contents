# Website Contents

This is a repository for hosting code and documentation related to some of the technical projects I have worked on over the last few years. It is currently organized into three groups, research, modeling-and-simulation, and electronics. Each folder has either files or sub-folders for each project in the group. More details for each project will be found in the respective project/group README. Thank you for checking out my website and projects.

## research
This group contains documents related to research projects I participated in as an undergraduate. This research was completed under the advisory of a professor and the data is currently awaiting publicaton in scientific journals. For more specifics on each project, navigate to the respective projects README.

## modeling-and-simulation
This group contains code and documents for computational physics models I worked on in MATLAB. For more specifics, navigate to the respective projects README.

## electronics
This group contains documents related to various electronics projects I have done, both as part of my academic curriculum and in my free time. I was involved in many electronics projects as an undergraduate, both as an individual contributor and in an advisory capacity as a teaching assistant. For more specifics, navigate to the electronics README.
