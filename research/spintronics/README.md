# Spintronics Research

Magnetic tunnel junctions, or MTJs, have been an important nanodevice in spintronics and industry applications. A number of MTJ parameters have been studied and explored in detail in an attempt to fully understand and better control these devices. With this, MTJs have been made increasingly complex over the years, with an increasing number of layers, and layers with various compositions. The focus of this research prohect is analyzing and minimizing the energy of operation and switching these MTJs. The complex junctions were foregone in favor of the traditional trilayer designs. One key step in controlling the energy needed to operate these junctions is exploring changes in the surface geometries of the interfacing layers of the junctions. Breaking symmetry at the surface of the crystal structures in ferromagnetic layers contributes to changes in the magnetic anisotropy of the layers. Because of  the change in anisotropy, there is a subsequent change in the required switching energy for the junction, which we demonstrate in this work. While many materials can be used for the layers in the MTJs, the samples explored were FeCo, MgO, and Fe layers. These trilayer junctions have a magnetoresistance from 60% to 200%. <p>This is only a brief description of the project but please feel free to read the [research paper](https://github.com/dan-bernstein/website-contents/blob/main/research/spintronics/DBernsteinMTJFinalPaper.pdf) I wrote which includes futher details, my specific contributions, and analysis. </p>

## Files
Above I have included a copy of the [final paper](https://github.com/dan-bernstein/website-contents/blob/main/research/spintronics/DBernsteinMTJFinalPaper.pdf) I wrote. This encapsulates the work I contributed to the project, as well as the larger goals and next steps for the project. I have also included a copy of the poster I presented at the American Physical Society March Meeting in Las Vegas in 2023.

## Collaboration

This work was conducted in the lab/under the guidance of Professor Abdel Isakovic at Colgate University in Fall 2022.
